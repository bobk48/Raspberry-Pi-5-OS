# Raspberry-Pi-5-OS
Raspberry Pi 5 OS System Administration Basics with systemd &amp; Python3

Notes:

0. If you want to run the Trixie version of the Raspberry Pi OS,
   you should do it as a bare metal install on a fresh microSD card.
   I'm in the process of verifying everything in the book on the new
   version, and will keep you posted about any differences (if any)
   between the Bookworm version and the Trixie version.
1. Section 1.2.4 works exactly as shown in the Trixie version of
   the Raspberry Pi OS. In step 4.d. on page 50, the reboot then
   happens from the uninitialized NVMe device, so you have to go
   through the steps to setup the system on the NVMe.
2. The website for this book at Taylor & Francis is as follows-

3. I've added all of the Python 3 code examples, they're in the file

py_code.zip

4. I also added all of the In-Chapter Exercise solutions, as the following-
