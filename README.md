# Raspberry-Pi-5-OS
Raspberry Pi 5 OS System Administration Basics with systemd &amp; Python3

I've put all the Notes & Errata in the file Notes.docx

As new information becomes available, I'll be updating that file.

I've added the instructions for remote CUPS printing on your WiFi network
in the file remote_print.docx.

I've also added an extra chapter for your use on the git command, and GitHub.
It's in the file Extra_git.docx. I hope it's useful for you! I've also included
an In-Chapter Exercise solutions file for it, named Extra_git_ICE_ans.docx.

In addition, I've added a complete chapter on text editing with nano, vi, vim
and gvim along with some Geany use. It's found at Text_Editors.docx. With it,
I also added a In-Chapter Exercise solutions file named Text_Editors_ICE. docx.
I hope beginners find this info on editors helpful!

Finally, I've added a complete chapter on ZFS, in a file named ZFS.docx
This extra chapter supplements the Section 1.9 in Chapter 1 of the book.
It is intended for more experienced users of the Raspberry Pi 5 OS.
