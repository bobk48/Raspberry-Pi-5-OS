# Raspberry-Pi-5-OS
Raspberry Pi 5 OS System Administration Basics with systemd &amp; Python3

I've put all the Notes & Errata in the file Notes.docx

As new information becomes available, I'll be updating that file.

I'm also working on a .docx file that shows how to use CUPS to remote

print from LibreOffice on a Raspberry Pi 5 to another Pi that has

a USB printer atached to it, via WiFi. Look for that soon!
